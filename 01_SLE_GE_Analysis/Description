# Description

This R script performs a basic exploratory analysis of gene expression data comparing "SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)" patient B cells to normal control B cells. The dataset contains probeset-level expression values.

## Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Load Expression Data**
   The data is read from a tab-delimited text file, with rows as probesets and columns as samples.

2. **Inspect Dataset**
   The script checks the dimensions and sample names to verify the structure of the data.

3. **Scatter Plots**
   * A plot comparing all probesets between a control and an SLE sample.
   * A focused plot on the first 20 probesets for better clarity.

4. **Gene Profile Plot**
   For the gene **IGLJ3** (probeset ID: `211881_x_at`), the expression profile across all samples is plotted to observe trends and variability.

5. **Boxplot by Condition**
   The expression of IGLJ3 is compared between **SLE** and **Control** groups using a boxplot with individual sample points overlaid to highlight distribution.

This script serves as an introductory analysis pipeline for visualizing and interpreting gene expression differences between disease and control conditions, useful for transcriptomic studies in autoimmune diseases like SLE.
