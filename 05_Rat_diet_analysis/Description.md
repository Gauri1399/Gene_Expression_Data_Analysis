# Rat Ketogenic vs Control Diet Gene Expression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of a **ketogenic diet** on gene expression in rats. Using high-throughput gene expression data, it identifies genes that are significantly altered by diet and visualizes these differences. The goal is to explore how dietary interventions influence metabolic and cellular processes.

## Dataset
- **Rows:** Genes/probesets  
- **Columns:** Samples from rats on either **ketogenic diet** or **control diet**  
- **Format:** Tab-delimited text file with genes as row names and samples as column names  

## Analysis Purpose
- Normalize and transform data (log2) to stabilize variance  
- Perform **Student’s t-tests** to identify genes differentially expressed between diet groups  
- Calculate **fold changes** to quantify the magnitude of gene expression differences  
- Adjust for multiple testing using **Bonferroni correction**  
- Visualize results with **p-value histograms** and **volcano plots**  

## Biological Significance
- Reveals genes and pathways influenced by a ketogenic diet  
- Highlights potential roles in **energy metabolism, lipid processing, inflammation, and mitochondrial function**  
- Provides candidate genes for follow-up studies to understand diet-related physiological effects  

## Key Results
- List of significantly differentially expressed genes  
- Fold change statistics for all genes  
- Volcano plots showing both magnitude and significance of gene expression changes
