## Rat Gene Expression Analysis: Ketogenic vs Control Diet

This project performs differential gene expression analysis on rat microarray data to compare the effects of a **ketogenic diet** versus a **control diet**. Using statistical methods such as **t-tests**, **fold-change analysis**, and **volcano plots**, the analysis identifies significantly differentially expressed genes.

### Features:

* Log2 transformation of gene expression data
* Group separation based on diet (control vs ketogenic)
* Student's t-tests for each probeset
* p-value histogram and Bonferroni correction
* Calculation of fold change (log2 and linear scale)
* Identification of significant genes
* Volcano plot visualization

### Files:

* `rat_KD.txt`: Input gene expression dataset

### Tools Used:

* R / R Markdown
* Base R functions: `t.test()`, `log2()`, `hist()`, `plot()`
* Basic statistical and data visualization techniques
