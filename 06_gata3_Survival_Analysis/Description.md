# Brain Aging and Breast Cancer Gene Expression Analysis

## Overview
This project explores **gene expression changes in the human brain due to aging** and the **prognostic role of GATA3 in breast cancer**. Using microarray data from the frontal cortex and RNA-seq data from TCGA, we perform **differential expression analysis, multiple testing correction, and survival modeling**.

**Key Goals:**
- Identify genes differentially expressed by **age and sex** in the human frontal cortex.
- Evaluate **GATA3 expression in breast cancer** and its association with survival.
- Perform **multiple testing adjustments** (Holm, Bonferroni).
- Visualize **p-value distributions** and **Kaplan–Meier survival curves**.

## Biological Motivation
Aging affects gene expression patterns in the brain, influencing cognition and neurodegeneration. By comparing **older vs younger subjects** and **male vs female patients**, we can identify molecular signatures of brain aging.  

In breast cancer, **GATA3** is a transcription factor critical for cell differentiation. Higher GATA3 expression is associated with **better survival outcomes**, while lower expression predicts **poorer prognosis**. This project confirms these associations using RNA-seq and survival analysis.

## Data Sets
- **Brain Aging Microarray:** HGU95A arrays, frontal cortex samples (18 male, 12 female)
- **TCGA Breast Cancer RNA-seq:** FPKM-normalized expression data for 119 patients
- **Annotation Files:** Sample metadata for both studies

## Methods / Workflow
1. **Load and explore data** using R (`read.table()`)
2. **Classify samples** by age, sex, and GATA3 expression groups
3. **Differential expression analysis** using t-tests on predefined gene vectors
4. **Multiple testing correction** (Holm, Bonferroni)
5. **Visualization** of sorted raw and adjusted p-values
6. **Survival analysis** with Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models

## Outcomes
- Identification of **age- and sex-related differentially expressed genes** in the frontal cortex
- Confirmation that **high GATA3 expression correlates with better survival** in breast cancer
- Comparison of **multiple testing adjustment methods**
- Hands-on experience with **microarray and RNA-seq analysis**, statistical testing, and survival modeling
